# MFDNN
mfdnn.py implements our core MFDNN methodology.

utils.py provides supporting functions and computational utilities.

"The code for MFDNN Paper" directory contains implementations of three methodologies evaluated on both simulated datasets and two real-world applications (PM2.5 and EEG data analysis). Each method is implemented in a separate dedicated file for clear comparison. Additionally, the repository includes runtime analysis code from Appendix B
